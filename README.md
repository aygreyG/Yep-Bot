### Features:
- Database which stores user ids and their corresponding balances.
- Music playing.
- Blackjack and coinflip (there is also a 1v1 feature which is kinda bad).

### What to look out for:
- There might be comments, commits or other things that are written in hungarian.
- There is an add command which only works if you change the id [here](./dcbot.js#L309) to your own id, you can easily get your id with the id command.
- If you have a problem just open an issue.
